# Bank-Management-System

A fully automated basic Bank Management System built using Python and MySQL, has been designed keeping in mind the objective facilitate a fully computerized automated system over the existing manual system. It has been observed that the present system contains many loop-holes which lead to faulty system outputs and data redundancy. Lots of manual/handwritten processes are involved in the current system which have been improved and converted to automated forms to produce error-less outputs.

The proposed system has the following silent features:
1. All the modules are loosely coupled and highly cohesive.
2. Lesser user intervention is achieved.
3. Variety of reports generation introduced.
4. Hassle free data entry.
